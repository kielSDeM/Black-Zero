Used nmap to find IP and open ports.
Then used nikto to scan for vulnerabilites 
sqlmap to do sqlinjections and find a user&password list
then I gained access to linux master after using a decoder.
to gain root privledges I created a soft link using the command ln -s /bin/vi tail.
Was able to login as root from there.
